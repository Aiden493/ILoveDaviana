                Daviana, ever since I met you, every day I’ve found myself falling more in love with you.
                I admire your personality, your values, and your perseverance more than I can put into words.
                I’ve grown such deep feelings for you, and I would do anything to make you happy.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are the first girl I’ve ever talked to who I’m not afraid to open up to and share my deepest
                thoughts with, and that means everything to me. I’m so grateful I had the opportunity to meet you.
                You’re someone I can cry with, laugh with, and create so many beautiful memories with.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also loved that we got to go on a date together. I truly enjoyed buying us a nice meal and then
                coming back to my place to cuddle while watching a movie. Being able to comfort you meant more
                to me than you know.
            </p>
